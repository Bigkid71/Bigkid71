      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> Hey there—I’m a husband, a father, and a lifelong builder. After many years working in the construction field, I’ve found myself at a crossroads: one chapter closing, and another opening. Today, I’m pursuing new paths, learning everything I can about networking, coding, and the Internet of Things. I'm driven by curiosity, and I'm seeking wisdom and purpose as I walk with God.
When I’m not diving into tech tutorials or tinkering with electronics in my audio studio, you’ll probably find me near the water, fishing rod in hand—unplugged but fully present. I love solving problems, making things work, and finding deeper meaning in both the process and the outcome.
This site is where I’ll share my journey, projects, and discoveries. Welcome to my corner of the internet.
